##Overview
A look at a Google Dataset with 150k wine reviews from Wine Spectator, with WS scores, prices, wine regions/countries, and an added sentiment analysis, which was performed using R/Syuzhet. The transformed dataset with sentiment analysis could be used by wine professionals or hobbyists who want a view to reviews, but don't want to rely on Wine Spectator points as a guideline.
